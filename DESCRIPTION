Description: This package makes use of the automatically generated n-gram frequency-tables of
	the package "stylo". It allows e.g. sociolinguistic researchers to browse the frequencies
	for specific forms, subset the data and connect with metadata of the texts. In addition 
	it allows to plot the frequencies on political maps, in order to display continua
	or border effects.
